#Features
  Lightweight Python script for reverse shell functionality.
  Supports remote command execution on the target machine.
  Simple structure, easily customizable for penetration testing and educational scenarios.

#How It Works
A reverse shell allows a machine to establish a connection back to a remote server. 
Once the connection is established, the remote server gains the ability to execute commands on the machine. 
This type of setup is commonly explored in the context of network security and penetration testing to understand how unauthorized access can occur and how it can be prevented.
